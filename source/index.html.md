# Getting Started

* Download any of our API SDK to fast access
    * <a href="https://github.com/notihub-io/notihub-java-sdk" target="_blank">Java SDK</a>
    * <a href="https://github.com/notihub-io/notihub-nodejs-sdk" target="_blank">Node.js SDK</a>
* Use those keys to start sending messages! 

#Environments

Notihub supports the creation up-to 20 environments per account. When you register your account, we will create for you the `development` and `production` environments. You can also create new ones like `staging`, `testing`, `dev-green`, `dev-red` or whatever other you need to adapt to your development flow. 

Keep in mind, that each customer you create, or message you sent will only be part of one environment. But all your environments will run through your quota usages. 

Each environment will have a pair of `clientId` and `clientSecret` keys, that you can use with your `publicKey` from you account, to obtain an access token.
